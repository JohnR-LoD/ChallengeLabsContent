- A cloud slice is a subset of a cloud platform subscription that has been assigned to a user account which was provisioned for you to use for the duration of this challenge lab. It provides temporary access to a subset of resources available in a cloud subscription so that you can learn the concepts in this challenge lab without having to configure your own subscription.
- A cloud slice has restrictions on the types of administrative activities that are allowed. Please follow the instructions carefully, especially with regard to names and other configuration details.
